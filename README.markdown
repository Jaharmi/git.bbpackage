A BBEdit package to make working with Git easier
===================================================

The great thing about BBEdit packages in BBEdit 10 is the fact that everything is gathered together in one place. This package contains useful tools for BBEdit & Git.

This package is part "code you can find elsewhere on the internet" (the Git Blame and diff language modules, for example), and new stuff that I just wrote.

Installation
============

    $ cd Library/Application\ Support/BBEdit/
    $ mkdir Packages # if it doesn't already exists
    $ cd Packages
    $ git clone https://github.com/rwilcox/git.bbpackage.git

And restart BBEdit.

Contributing
======================

Please feel free to contribute. However, there is something to keep in mind: BBEdit for some reason doesn't like the uncompiled versions of some Applescripts (for example, the git commit Applescript).

Plus, having BBEdit compile an Applescript every time is much slower than compiling it once.

To avoid this, I've created a ApplescriptSources folder. Modify the .applescript file here, then save a compiled version in the Scripts/git folder.

At some point I'll write a shell script or Makefile to automate this process, or figure out what's wrong...
